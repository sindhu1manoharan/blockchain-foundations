Day 1 (Monday): Cryptography + Hashing + Lab 1
* Day 2 (Wednesday): Merkle Trees + Wallet logic + Labs 2 & 3
* Day 3 (Friday): Consensus + Transaction lifecycle + Lab 4


Topic 1: Cryptography – The Backbone of Blockchain
What is Cryptography?
Cryptography is the science of securing information so that only intended parties can read or modify it. 
Blockchain relies on cryptography to replace trust in humans with trust in mathematics.
Blockchain uses cryptography for:
* Data integrity
* Ownership verification
* Transaction security
* Identity without usernames/passwords

Hash Functions
A hash function converts input data of any size into a fixed-length output called a hash.
Key Properties:
* Deterministic (same input = same output)
* One-way (cannot reverse-engineer input)
* Avalanche effect (small change → big output change)
Blockchain Usage:
* Linking blocks
* Detecting tampering
* Creating transaction fingerprints

Public & Private Key Cryptography
Blockchain wallets use asymmetric cryptography:
* Private Key: Secret key that proves ownership
* Public Key: Derived from private key
* Address: Shortened hash of public key
Whoever controls the private key controls the assets.

Digital Signatures
Digital signatures prove:
* Who sent the transaction
* That the transaction was not altered
Process:
1. Transaction is created
2. Signed using private key
3. Verified using public key

Topic 2: Merkle Trees – Data Integrity at Scale
What is a Merkle Tree?
A Merkle Tree is a hierarchical structure of hashes that efficiently summarizes large amounts of data.
Used in:
* Bitcoin blocks
* Ethereum blocks
* Distributed file systems

Why Merkle Trees are Needed
* Efficient verification
* Reduced storage requirement
* Faster synchronization between nodes
A single transaction change modifies the Merkle root.

Topic 3: Consensus Mechanisms
Why Consensus is Required
In a decentralized system, nodes must agree on:
* Which transactions are valid
* Which block is the latest
This problem is known as the Byzantine Generals Problem.

Proof of Work (PoW)
* Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles
* High energy consumption
* Very secure
Used by: Bitcoin

Proof of Stake (PoS)
* Validators are selected based on stake
* Energy efficient
* Faster finality
Used by: Ethereum (after The Merge)

Topic 4: Lifecycle of a Blockchain Transaction
1. Transaction creation
2. Transaction signing
3. Broadcasting to network
4. Block proposal
5. Block validation
6. Block confirmation & finality
Transactions are not instant — they require consensus.

PART B: PRACTICAL LAB MATERIAL (WORD FORMAT)

LAB 1: Hashing & Immutability Experiment
Objective
To observe how blockchain achieves immutability using cryptographic hashing.
Steps
1. Enter text into a SHA-256 generator
2. Generate hash
3. Modify text slightly
4. Generate hash again
Observation
Even a tiny change produces a completely different hash.
Student Output
* Screenshots
* Explanation in own words

LAB 2: Merkle Tree Construction
Objective
Understand how transactions are secured inside a block.
Steps
1. Create 4 sample transactions
2. Hash each transaction
3. Combine hashes step-by-step
4. Identify Merkle root
Observation
Changing one transaction alters the Merkle root.

LAB 3: Wallet & Key Ownership Demo
Objective
Understand how blockchain wallets work internally.
Steps
1. Create a test wallet
2. Identify public address
3. Understand private key importance
Critical Rule
Never share private keys.

LAB 4: Proof of Work vs Proof of Stake Analysis
Objective
Compare consensus mechanisms using real blockchain data.
Steps
1. Observe Bitcoin block creation time
2. Observe Ethereum block creation time
3. Compare energy, speed, cost

PART C: GITHUB ASSIGNMENT (MANDATORY)
Students must create and commit the following files:
* hashing.md
* merkle-tree.md
* wallet-cryptography.md
* consensus-comparison.md
Minimum 4 commits required.
