WEEK 2 – THEORY SYLLABUS 
Module 1: Cryptography Basics for Blockchain (FOUNDATION)
Concepts to Cover
What is Cryptography?
Hash functions (Deep dive)
Public Key & Private Key cryptography
Digital signatures
Why blockchain depends on cryptography
Key Teaching Points
Blockchain ≠ database, it’s crypto + networking
Wallets do NOT store coins, they store private keys
Whoever owns the private key owns the assets


Module 2: Hashing & Merkle Trees (BLOCK STRUCTURE)
Concepts to Cover
SHA-256 (Bitcoin) & Keccak-256 (Ethereum)
Properties of cryptographic hash functions
Merkle tree structure
Why Merkle trees are used in blocks
Key Teaching Points
One character change → completely different hash
Merkle trees reduce verification cost
Used to prove data integrity efficiently


Module 3: Consensus Mechanisms (CORE OF DECENTRALIZATION)
Concepts to Cover
Why consensus is needed
Byzantine Generals Problem
Proof of Work (PoW)
Proof of Stake (PoS)
Ethereum’s transition (The Merge)
Key Teaching Points
Consensus = agreement without trust
PoW secures with energy
PoS secures with money (stake)



Module 4: How a Block is Created (END-TO-END FLOW)
Concepts to Cover
Transaction creation
Transaction broadcasting
Block formation
Block validation
Block finalization
Key Teaching Points
Transactions are NOT instant
Validators/miners decide block inclusion
Finality matters in blockchain
